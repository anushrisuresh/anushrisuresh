## Hi, I’m Anushri! 👋

I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at **Johns Hopkins University**, working on **efficient machine learning** and **large language model (LLM) inference optimization**.

My current research focuses on making LLMs more efficient at test time through:

- **Inference-time early exiting**
- **Test-time scaling strategies**
- **KV-cache compression & quantization**
- **Speculative decoding**
- **Memory- and compute-efficient reasoning pipelines**

I’m affiliated with the **Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)** at JHU and collaborate with the **InfiniAI Lab at CMU**.

Previously, I worked across research and applied ML roles at **Bosch** and the **University of Zurich**, and I also have experience in **computer vision** from earlier academic projects.

**Interests:**  
LLM Inference Optimization · Efficient ML · Test-Time Scaling · Quantization · NLP Systems
